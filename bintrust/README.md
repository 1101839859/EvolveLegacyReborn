# INSTRUCTION

1. Open DLL1.sln then compile it.And then use WINHEX to open EVOLVE.exe, fix its "WINTRUST.DLL" to "BINTRUST.dll".
2. put the compile file in game's folder, between EVOLVE.exe.
3. create txt file named "evolvecrack.txt","serverip.txt","serverport.txt"
4. open serverip.txt and write your fake server's ip (for localhost write 127.0.0.1, seems if have domain there will be bug, I don't know why.),and open serverport.txt write your fake server's port.(For local test:127.0.0.1:2000)

you can download this sample file in my release(2.0).



Then use goldberg's emulator (Experimental_Steamclient version) to crack this game.

If wanna use it without loader, just rename it to pinenut64.dll, then create a txt file named "evolvelan.txt".

If just wanna make a gui, it's no use to change these code, but if add features, maybe it will be needed.
